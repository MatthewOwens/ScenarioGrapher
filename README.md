Scenario Grapher
================

Overview
--------

Scenario Grapher is a tool to aid game developers in the creation of robust, complex, branching scenarios through the use of directed graphs.

Currently in a pre-release state the following features are supported:
* Creation of dialogue modules
* Exporting and Importing of dialogue graphs to JSON
* Tracking user-created story flags on a 'local' scale within a single dialogue module
* Tracking user-created story flags on a 'global' scale across multiple dialogue modules

In addition, the following features are planned to be implemented in the near future:
* The creation of meta-modules that describe how to traverse from one dialogue module to the next
* The creation of sub-modules that inherit a parent module's 'local' flags
